# tf_fast_neural_style
### A fast neural style transfer network coded in Tensorflow

### This project is based on the Stanford University Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155

## Requirements:
  Python 3.5 <br />
  Tensorflow 1.3 <br />
  Scipy <br />
  Pretrained VGG19 Network: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/beta16/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat
  
## Training:
  Requires a TFRecords file of jpeg images <br />
  Training on PASCAL VOC 2007 Dataset is recommended, will resize to 256 x 256 pixels
 
## Running the program:
  The program uses the Python Argument Parser Module and includes help documentation that lists the arguments such as filepaths and batchsize

## Checkpoints and Visualization:
  Utilizes Tensorboard to track training loss every 100 Iterations and to visualize the computation graph <br />
  Checkpoints are saved every 100 Iterations for easy testing of current results

## Styling Images:
  After a checkpoint is generated by train.py, styleimage.py can be run to transform the desired image into its styled counterpart
  
This was a great project to learn Tensorflow and build my own network from scratch! Enjoy!
